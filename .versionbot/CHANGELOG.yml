                Some kernel configuration are only applicable from specific
                kernel

                versions. This commit adds a function that allows to add a
                specific

                configuration set only from a given kernel version.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the
                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it
                relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h
                being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the
                source.

                Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

                events

                instead of 'up/down' events.


                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in
                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have
                chosen.

                Triggered by a failue in the VPN test - the bash binary is
                bigger than

                the openvpn binary and on devices with limitted rootfs space the
                copying

                is not possible. Symlinking /dev/null will break the services as
                well.

                Having the lines limited to 500 meant we were missing
                a lot of logs.

                We also don't need to list boots and can use the 'all'
                arguement to see all logs.

                In recent kernels (i.e. 5.10.31 for Raspberry Pi) the

                arch/arm/kernel/module.lds file got moved. See

                596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.


                Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc
                from the

                hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for
                        cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in
                        `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries
                        (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download
                        anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        simultaneously.

                        Similarly when processing the destination layers to

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                This target service can be used to restart other services
                that have explicitly set themselves as PartOf this target.

                So a service that should be restarted when config.json changes
                can use PartOf=config-json.target to be triggered automatically.

                Since we don't have devices using older 3.x kernels we update to
                a newer

                kernel

                module on newer kernels.

                This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64

                raspberrypicm4-ioboard for example where it would complain
                _mcount is

                undefined because the older gcc in the
                intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717

                base image would not create the _mcount symbol when compiling
                against

                the newer 5.10.31 kernel.

                Add smoke test


                Resolve `latest` to dev variant


                If we want the serial logs of the DUT the image that is flashed
                needs to

                be the development variant. The `latest` shortcut however always

                resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the
                version to fix

                this.

                based on

                the partition sizes on the balena image classes.


                The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total
                BalenaOS

                size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB
                partitions. The

                data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage
                media.


                Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

                This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)

                connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the

                CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states.
                This

                service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be
                used

                to delay the start of other services which require full network

                access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems
                on

                networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.


                The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make
                sure

                that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is

                redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is
                started

                before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The
                initial

                check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the
                script

                standalone or post-boot.


                Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait
                for

                full network connectivity should add the following entries to
                their

                systemd unit definition:


                Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the
                engine

                unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in
                unit for

                reference.


                Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts
                those

                overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it
                would be

                possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without
                remounting

                the rootfs to be writeable.

                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update
                step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the
                balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not
                exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                After a hostapp-update we need to migrate the supervisor.conf
                currently

                mounted from /etc/resin-supervisor in the state cache partition.


                Avoid deleting the old supervisor state cache in case of
                rollback.

                Also check that supervisor.conf exists before attempting
                to start the service.

              hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c

                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device
                into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update
                our

                build before upgrading further.

                Hardknott introduces get_linuxloader() to linuxloader.bbclass
                that

                allows for dynamically choosing between different c libraries,

                recipes depend on.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing
                string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable
                rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly
                when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json
                itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager
                script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                        Show warning instead of exception for invalid network
                        config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a

                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam
                        config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for
                        each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if
                        the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because
                        that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in
                        local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new
                        one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the
                        logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures,
                        it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided
                        network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an
                        earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets
                        to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version
                        no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on
                        supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with
                        livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be
                immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

                This is needed in preparation for storage migration from aufs to
                overlayfs.

                When running hostapp-update, we need to create the target
                hostapp on

                overlayfs, which implies the OS we update from can support both
                drivers

              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of
                this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary
                into

                a separate procps package:

                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into
                compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than
                gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c
              body: >
                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.
